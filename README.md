## Getting Started

Create a new repository in GitHub called HW-Wireframe.
Clone this repository to your computer by following the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the HW-Wireframe folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: index.html and style.css.
Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub.

git add .
